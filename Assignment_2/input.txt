    """"
    According to research at an English university, it does not matter in what order the letters in
    a word are, the only important thing is that the first and last letter are in the right place.
    The rest can be a total mess and you can still read it without a problem. This is because we 
    do not read every letter by itself but the word as a whole and the brain figures it out 
    anyway.
